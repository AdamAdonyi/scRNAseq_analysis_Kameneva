scRNA-seq Analysis for Kameneva Lab PhD Selection

This repository contains the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis pipeline performed by Adam Adonyi for the Kameneva Lab PhD selection process. The analysis focuses on identifying cell types, performing trajectory inference, and exploring gene expression changes across developmental stages in adrenal medulla-related populations.
